Hi, I'm Tionna Jackson- a data analyst with a background in psychology and crisis intervention. After several years supporting individuals and managing high-stakes decision making, I discovered a passion for using data to identify trends, uncover insights and drive data-informed decisions.  
I specialize in: 
  Data Analysis & Visualization (Excel, Tableau)
  Data Management (SQL, data cleaning) 
  Process & People Insights 

My approach is using data not just to optimize workflows, but to understand and improve human experiences within organizations. I'm currently building projects focused on process optimization, people analytics & workforce insights and data-driven decision making in operations. 

Currently exploring advanced SQL for business insights, predictive analytics and data visualizations.
